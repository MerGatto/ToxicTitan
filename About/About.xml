    [b]WARNING:[/b] This is a StationeersMods Plugin Mod. It requires Bepinex to be installed with the StationeersMods plugin.

    [h2]Description[/h2]
    ToxicTitan is my attempt at creating a more challenging alternative to Europa, inspired by [b]vivi[/b] and [b]murk[/b]. This version features two different weather events:
    [list]
    [*][b]Acid Methane Rain (Volatiles)[/b] - Most commonly occurring.
    [*][b]Snow Storms[/b] - Less frequent but still hazardous.
    [/list]
    These world settings can function independently, but for the intended experience, installing [url="https://github.com/jixxed/StationeersMods"]StationeersMods[/url] is recommended.

    [h3]Features with StationeersMods Installed[/h3]
    [list]
    [*]The [b]first weather event[/b] occurs [b]after 1 day[/b] instead of 7.
    [*]The [b]first weather event[/b] is always [b]Acid Rain[/b].
    [*][b]Acid Rain[/b] and [b]Snow Storms[/b] do [b]not[/b] trigger forced follow-up events (e.g., 'Regular' rain).
    [/list]

    For an added challenge, consider using  [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3336803492]Free Lunch's Structure Thermodynamics mod[/url] alongside this world.

    [h2]Gameplay Tips[/h2]
    [list]
    [*][b]Prepare early![/b] Weather events will start quickly, so prioritize creating a [b]safe storage space[/b].
    [*][b]Beware of airlocks![/b] Acid Rain leaves [b]liquid volatile puddles[/b], which do [b]not[/b] count towards room pressure. Use a [b]custom airlock script[/b] or a [b]manual airlock with a liquid drain[/b].
    [*][b]Solar power is ineffective[/b] due to frequent storms, but [b]wind power is reliable[/b].
    [*][b]Coal is rare on the surface[/b] but can be found using [b]deep miners[/b].
    [*][b]Oxite ice is scarce[/b], but [b]Nitric ice can substitute[/b] for furnace usage.
    [*][b]Leverage the cold atmosphere[/b]â€”[b]Gas Fuel Generators[/b] are easier to set up.
    [/list]

Titan, Saturn's largest moon, is a frozen, methane-rich world with treacherous storms and toxic rain, offering both danger and potential for human survival.
