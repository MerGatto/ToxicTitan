    My attempt on titan, inspired by vivi and murk.
    This version features 3 different weather events, most often you'll encounter Acid Methane(Volatiles) Rain, but occusionally you'll also encounter Snow storms and dust storms.
    This worldsettings will work on it's own but for the intended exprience (mostly weather fixes and patches) you'll need to have StationeersMods installed (https://github.com/jixxed/StationeersMods).
