# ToxicTitan

**WARNING:** This is a StationeersMods Plugin Mod. It requires BepInEx to be installed with the StationeersMods plugin.  
See: [StationeersMods](https://github.com/jixxed/StationeersMods)

## Description
ToxicTitan is my attempt at creating a more challenging alternative to Europa, inspired by *vivi* and *murk*. This version features two different weather events:
- **Acid Methane Rain (Volatiles)** - Most commonly occurring.
- **Snow Storms** - Less frequent but still hazardous.

These world settings can function independently, but for the intended experience, installing [StationeersMods](https://github.com/jixxed/StationeersMods) is recommended.

## Features with StationeersMods Installed
- The **first weather event** occurs **after 1 day** instead of 7.
- The **first weather event** is always **Acid Rain**.
- **Acid Rain** and **Snow Storms** do *not* trigger forced follow-up events (e.g., 'Regular' rain).

For an added challenge, consider using **Free Lunch's Structure Thermodynamics mod** alongside this world:

## Gameplay Tips
- **Prepare early!** Weather events will start quickly, so prioritize creating a **safe storage space**.
- **Beware of airlocks!** Acid Rain leaves **liquid volatile puddles**, which do *not* count towards room pressure. Use a **custom airlock script** or a **manual airlock with a liquid drain**.
- **Solar power is ineffective** due to frequent storms, but **wind power is reliable**.
- **Coal is rare on the surface** but can be found using **deep miners**.
- **Oxite ice is scarce**, but **Nitric ice can substitute** for furnace usage.
- **Leverage the cold atmosphere**—**Gas Fuel Generators** are easier to set up.
